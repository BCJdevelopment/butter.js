## About
This javascript library is largely based on the "Luxy.js" library written by Mineo Okuda: https://github.com/min30327/luxy.js

This library is meant to be a lightweight momentum scrolling library. Because of this, it does not currently support individual parallax elements (support for this may be included in a similar library soon).
